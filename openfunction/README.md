## Build hello world function in Go
Follow [these](https://openfunction.dev/docs/concepts/function_build/#build-functions-with-the-pack-cli) and [these](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/knative/hello-world-go#sample-function-go) instructions, mainly the first link.

You'll have to follow the links in the first link to install the `pack` cli.
Then once the function is running you'll have to visit it with `curl http://localhost:8080/world` for it to say `Hello, world!`, or whatever other thing you want to say hello to!
