# SAMBA
Enabling Confidential and Collaboritive Cloud Functions

## Overview
This Master's Research Project explores ensuring confidentiality of data in serverless systems, even in the case of an untrusted cloud provider, using proxy re-encryption. This repo implements the Go library, and the [samba-lite example](#samba-lite-example) implements it in a simplified system. Research into the topic continues at William & Mary's [etclab](https://github.com/etclab). You can find the paper I wrote on this project [here](https://github.com/Matthew-Berthoud/samba-paper).

## Samba-Lite example
- [this](https://github.com/Matthew-Berthoud/pre) repo
- proxy, alice, bob, and sender in `cmd/`
    - run `make` and then run those 4 binaries in that order
